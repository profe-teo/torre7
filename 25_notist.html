        <p>About Notist</p>
        <h2>Who’s behind this?</h2>
        <p>
            Notist is a project originally founded by Drew McLellan and Rachel Andrew, and now owned and operated by
            Drew. We know a lot about content management, and we know a lot about public speaking. We thought we would
            bring these two things together and that place is Notist. Somewhere not just to host slides, but everything
            from the handouts to share with listeners to their thoughts by way of curated social media posts.</p>
        <p>
            At the start of 2023 Rachel stepped back to focus on other projects, and Notist continues under Drew’s
            guidance at Under Engineering Ltd.</p>
